## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

# Steps of creating a navigation

## Editing the HTML File
1- Add 2 sections in the index.html.

### Editing the CSS File
1- Add styles to the nav tag 
  * Background color 
  * width 
  * Height 
  * padding

2- Set text align of the UL Itmes in the navbar to left instead of right. 

3- Add a media screen to make the navbar resposive on 400px.

4- Add a background and a color to the active state to the anchors tag.

#### Editing the JavaScript File
I have added two functions(First is the heleper function to know which 
element in the viewport, Second is the main function to create 
the navbar menu) and an event on scrolling I used the helper function 
to set the element on the viewport as active.
